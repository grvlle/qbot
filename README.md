## Getting Started

Simply clone the repo, populate the fields in the [a relative link](example_config.yaml) file and `go run .` in the root directory.

### Pre-requisites

A Slack bot API token needs to be created. This can be done over at [a link](https://api.slack.com/).

A Database also needs to be setup. QBot is utilizing the [GORM library](github.com/jinzhu/gorm) for database modeling. Which means that it's nativeley supporting mySQL, Postgres and SQLlite3. For mySQL databases, populate the database fields in the [a relative link](example_config.yaml) as following.

```
database:
  type: "mysql" # Dialect e.g. sqlite3
  database: "qbot" # Name of database
  user: "root" # Username
  password: "qbot" # Password
```

## Built With

## Getting Started

To deploy QBot, simply clone the repo, populate the fields in the [config.yaml](example_config.yaml) file and run `go run .` in the root directory of the repository.

### Pre-requisites

A Slack bot API token needs to be created. This can be done over at [Slack's official website](https://api.slack.com/).

A Database also needs to be setup. QBot is utilizing the [GORM library](github.com/jinzhu/gorm) for database modeling. Which means that it's nativeley supporting MySQL, Postgres and sqlite3. For MySQL databases, populate the database fields in the [config.yaml](example_config.yaml) as following.

```yaml
database:
  type: "mysql"        # Dialect e.g. sqlite3
  database: "qbot"     # Name of database
  user: "root"         # Username
  password: "qbot"     # Password
```
